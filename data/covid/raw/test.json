                "patient_text": "My father 82 years old was in the hospital for pneumonia and per cardiac catherization showing blockage. It was diagnosed that blockage was too much for bypass or stent. Only medication is given to help heart. Heart muscles also showed dead so it was no use to have bypass surgery per cardiac physician as even if blockage removed muscles would not help heart. My question is that now released from home he has been very uncomfortable during night sleep. He moans while asleep. He gets up and sits on bed. He then lays back and the same continues. He states being tired from hospital stay. He states he is tired from stay in hospital like hospital bed etc.  He really gets to sleep at 6 am and then during the day he is fine. Then the next night it starts again. Has been home since Feb. 2. Current medical doctor provided meds to sleep but that was worse. My mother is the primary caretaker and has reported his night sleep is off after returning home. Does the new diagnosis cause this or is there is a reason. Thanks.",

I have had no fever, cold etc Yesterday I felt very lightheaded and also after an episode of diarrea this morning am lightheaded again... I have no trouble breathing as such but I suffer from anxiety which I think has been happening alot today. I have had some twinge type pains in my lower chest ( like at the bottom of ribs) for a few days but not necessarily when I breath in and out and when I do cough I have had mucus? Come up, it s almost like it s stuck in my throat also.... I have some head pressure and am getting cold feet every now and then everything I ve checked says pneumonia does this sound like what I could have or could it just be anxiety, I m a little worried...the symptoms separately come and go but my head stays feeling.a little heavy!

By this, we can achieve speedy recovery. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wishing good health to your friend. Thanks.",

Pneumonia can cause pleurisy (inflammation of pleura) and this can cause similar kind of pain. So in my opinion, you should first get the chest X-ray done. If the chest X-ray is worsening, then your pain is due to pneumonia and you will need higher antibiotics. But if the chest X-ray is improving, then possibility of musculoskeletal pain is more likely. So apply warm water pad on the affected areas. Avoid movements causing pain. Avoid sudden jerky movements of the chest. Take simple painkillers and muscle relaxant drugs like Ibuprofen and Thiocolchicoside. Don't worry, you will be alright with all these. Hope I have solved your query. I will be happy to help you further. Wish you good health. Thanks.",
